## Assignment 1 

An implementation of the Barrel.h class. Created functions which can:

* "Add Water" to the Barrel - The user can add water to the Barrel

* "Add Olive Oil" to the Barrel - Olive oil automatically floats on top of water since it is less dense

* "Drain" the contents of the Barrel - Draining will start draining the water first since the drain is located at the bottom of the Barrel

* Simulate an "Overflow" effect - If the user adds an excess amount of water or olive oil (more than the capacity of the Barrel), then olive oil will get removed first and then, water (since oil is floating on top of the Barrel)

## Assignment 2

An implementation of the Sequence class using an array to store the sequenceâ€™s items.

## Assignment 3

An implementation of a revised Sequence Class that uses a dynamic array to store the items.

## Assignment 4

An implementation of a revised Sequence Class that uses a linked list to store the items.

## Assignment 5

You will write three small recursive problems to solve different problems:
1. **The triangle function** - Create the function which prints the shape described there. Hint: Only one of the arguments changes in the recursive call.
2. **The stepping stone function** - Write the recursive function int count_ways_to_step(int number_of_stepping_stones) that takes a positive number_of_stepping_stones value and returns the number of different ways to traverse the pond. Hint: Wherever you are you have two choices of how to make your next step (except if you are 1 stepping stone from the finish).
3. **The maze solving function** - Write a function which will print this path printing 0s for left turns and 1s for right turns. You may print the path in reverse order (this will be easier).

## Assignment 6

An implementation of the bag template class using a binary search tree to store the items.
