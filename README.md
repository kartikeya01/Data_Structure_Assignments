# Data Structures
A collection of various Data Structure Projects I have completed from CSC21200 - Data Structures

## Assignment1 

An implementation of the Barrel.h class. Created functions which can:

"Add Water" to the Barrel - The user can add water to the Barrel

"Add Olive Oil" to the Barrel - Olive oil automatically floats on top of water since it is less dense

"Drain" the contents of the Barrel - Draining will start draining the water first since the drain is located at the bottom of the Barrel

Simulate an "Overflow" effect - If the user adds an excess amount of water or olive oil (more than the capacity of the Barrel), then olive oil will get removed first and then, water (since oil is floating on top of the Barrel)
